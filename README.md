I'm thinking I go through iterations:

This one can be a simple C & Makefile project.

I make a producer pipeline that outputs to network and another consumer pipeline that gets from NW and outputs to screen.

That's all. No other requirements. MVP only. Then in streaming002 and so on I can get into more detail, while also changing languages and protocols.
